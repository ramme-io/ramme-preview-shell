## 🚀 Quick Start for Designers

You don't need to be a coding wizard to use this. Just follow these 3 steps:

### 1. Setup (Do this once)
You need **Node.js** installed on your computer.
- Open your terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal app).
- Type `node -v` to see if you have it. If not, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

### 2. Create your Project
Run this magic command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create @ramme-io/app@latest
```

It will ask you for a project name (e.g., my-smart-home). Type it and hit Enter.

## Run it!

You will be prompted to name your project.

**1. Enter the project directory**
```bash
cd my-new-project
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pnpm install
# or npm install
```

**3. Start the dev server**
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Your prototype is now running locally at `http://localhost:5173`.
